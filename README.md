# Language_predictor

This project was created in a group of two as a part od OOP course. The main goal was to predict whether the text that we are providing is
English, Polish or German. The algorithm is based on monogram and bigram counts( the frequency of appering certain letters in language) in articles from Wikipedia. We used jsoup parsers to extract raw text from HTML.

Another functionality is text prediction. The algorithms suggest possible words based on the previous one.
